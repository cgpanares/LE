# LE Session Manager
an executable application which creates a timer of the session initiated by the user who logged on to the machine. It will run for specific users. Once the timer runs out (which the user has the capability to extend its session), the user will be automatically logged out. This is to ensure that no sessions will be left opened to prevent occupying unused resources in that particular machine.
